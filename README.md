# CaSPar_RDRSv2

This code converts the precipitation and temperature variables from the Regional Deterministic Reforecast System (RDRS_v2; hourly dataset) into Matlab variables at a desired time step and aggregated at the basin scale.

## RDRS-v2 variables in the code:

|**Variable** | **Variable long name**|	**Unit**|	**Level**|
|----------------|-----------------------------------|-----|----|
|RDRS_v2_P_PR0_SFC| Quantity of precipitation (model) | [m] | SFC|
|RDRS_v2_P_TT_1.5m | Air temperature | [Â°C]	|1.5m|

## Information required to use the code
The following information must be specified in the code block that comprises lines 12-31 (identified as "THE ONLY PART TO MODIFY")
Catchments' name (nameC).  
Time step (TS)
netCDF files path (dataPath)
Shapefiles path (shpPath). Shapefiles must have the name of the catchment: name1.shp, name2.shp,...nameN.shp 
Output (OutPath)
```
