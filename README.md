# CasPar_data

This code converts the precipitation and temperature variables from the Regional Deterministic Reforecast System (RDRS_v2; hourly dataset) into Matlab variables at a desired time step and aggregated at the basin scale.

RDRS-v2 product:

|**Variable** | **Variable long name**|	**Unit**|	**Level**|
|----------------|-----------------------------------|-----|----|
|RDRS_v2_P_PR0_SFC| Quantity of precipitation (model) | [m] | SFC|
|RDRS_v2_P_TT_1.5m | Air temperature | [Â°C]	|1.5m|


RDRS_v2_P_PR0_SFC: Model forecasted precipitation (background field used by CaPA to produce the analysis) labelled with etiquette RDRS02PROD in the original FST files provided by ECCC and called as RDRS_v2_P_PR0_SFC in the NetCDF files provided through CaSPAr
